	<p>  		The purpose of this website is to upload my java projects, which have real world  applications.</p>
	<p>                I will be using some of classes which are available from the princeton university website.</p>
	<p>                 If you are interested in the implementations of these classes, feel free to check them in the link below.</p>

	<h3>StringToChar   Class</h3>

	<p>

        This class is used to separate a string into an array of characters.

        Since the implementation of this class utilizes files , data from a file/internet can be separated into an array of characters.
        This simple but powerfull class can be used to manipulate strings of any kind.
        My implementation uses the standard library(stdlib) from Princeton University. If you are interested in this class, you may download it below. </p>

	<h3> Tic-tac-toe </h3>
	<p> This is a classic game most of us used to play on paper, until now &#128540;.I used The StdDraw class from princeton, simply because it takes care of the minor issues of game dev.
	    This is not the best class for game dev, but its good for begineers and it gets the job done.
	    Make sure when unziping the game all the components are in the same directory.I included the source code for those who are interested, feel free to critique my work.
	    Lastly bare in mind I am new to java development so my algorithms might be slow(easy), once againg constructive criticism is highly appreciated.
